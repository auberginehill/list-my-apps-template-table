 <tr><td>Type:</td><td>Template-file for an Android app called 'List My Apps'</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Language:</td><td>mostly HTML (with extra variables)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Description:</td><td>This template (when run in an app called 'List My Apps') creates a HTML list (in table format) of the apps installed on the device.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Remarks:</td><td>- List My Apps templates consist of three fields ("List header", "Item format" and "List footer").</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- The actual template code in this file can be found under the following headers:</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-- File Header: = "List header, may be blank"</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-- Body: = "Item format, may not be blank"</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-- File Footer: = "List footer, may be blank"</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- A template inside a template doesn't work that well with variables that need to be presented "as they are" in code i.e. not triggered when running the actual script. Two main culprits here are the character $ in the 'List My Apps' -app and the instances where source code is displayed inside a HTML page.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-- In 'List My Apps' -app [dollar_sign] should be left as they are(, if the template code has been copied from this page (i.e. http://pastebin.com/ADaRiDYq)).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-- After a HTML-file has been created, the template included in the bottom of that file is limited. If that limited template of the created HTML-file is to be used as a template in 'List My Apps' -app:</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>--- All instances of [dollar_sign] need to be changed with $</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>--- File Footer ends before [End Of Line].</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Tutorial:</td><td>To open this code with an Android device, for instance:</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1. Create a new template in 'List My Apps' -app's Template Editor by clicking Options (three dots) - Template Editor - Add. [Screenshot: http://groovyandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/List-My-Apps-select-all.png]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2. Type in a name for the template. [Screenshot: http://groovyandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/List-My-Apps-Template-Editor.png]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>3. Paste all the appropriate template data (the three sections as specified below) to 'List My Apps' and save the template.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- File Header: = "List header, may be blank"</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- Body: = "Item format, may not be blank"</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- File Footer: = "List footer, may be blank"</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>4. Go back to the 'List My Apps' -app's home screen and select the name that was created in Step 2 from the 'Copy/Share as:' -dropdown menu. Please also select the apps that you'd like to be included in the list. [Screenshot: http://groovyandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/List-My-App-HTML-list.png]</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>5. 'Run' the 'List My Apps' -app with the new template by copying the app data to Clipboard [Copy] (since direct sharing may not work, if a lot of applications has been installed).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- There seems to be some kind of a limit, how much data the Clipboard can contain. With verbose templates ~200 apps might be the upper limit, but with a simple template, the Clipboard clearly is capable of containing considerably more apps.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>6. Open an HTML editor, such as DroidEdit Free.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>7. Paste the app data (source code generated by 'List My Apps' in Step 5) from Clipboard to the HTML editor.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- If nothing happens (no data is copied to an HTML editor), try selecting fewer apps in 'List My Apps' and go back to Step 5.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- If "old data" gets copied to an HTML editor (i.e. "the data that was in the Clipboard before 'List My Apps' apps' 'Copy to Clipboard' button was clicked"), try selecting fewer apps in 'List My Apps' and go back to Step 5.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>8. Save the file as an .html-file, for example as 'Installed_Apps.html' in Home/Documents folder (a filename without any spaces is recommended).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>9. Open the .html-file with an appropriate app, for example with a browser by surfing to the file location, which could, for instance, be: <a href="file:///storage/emulated/0/Documents/Installed_Apps.html">file:///storage/emulated/0/Documents/Installed_Apps.html</a></td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>- In a browser the spaces in the filename can be replaced with %20 to make the link work (there's an underscore in the example file's file name (and URL) above instead of a space character). For more exotic filename characters, see HTML URL Encoding Reference: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>10. Conversion from .html to .pdf might work with Firefox for Android (Options (three dots) - Page - Save as PDF) or perhaps with the printing option in the default File Manager.</td></tr>
